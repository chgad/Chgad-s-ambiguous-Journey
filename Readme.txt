Hallo Folks,

i'm fairly new to programming and learning it by self studdying. Currently learning from various online tutorialls and making up some code from examples used in those tutorials.

Another source of "wisdom" is a friend of mine studdying Medical-It who gives me insight in OOP and some Programming techniques.

In this matter feel free to look over my code and give me inspiration, critics and i would highly appreciate any exercises or examples you can give .

P.S.: Who ever finds mistakes of any kind in this text : keep them for yourselves :D !
